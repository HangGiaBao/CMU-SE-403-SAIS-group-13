1. What happens if a client requests a Fibonacci with a very large n (e.g. 10 million)? Will the system respond in a timely manner?

2. Suppose the fibonacciGenerator fails (e.g. due to invalid input or system failure), the API fails to process and responds with a non-delimited response?

3. If the server is overloaded (overloaded), will the API continue to return incorrect results, or will it time out or crash?
