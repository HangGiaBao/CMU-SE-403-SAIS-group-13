1. What happens if a client requests a Fibonacci with a very large n (e.g. 10 million)? Will the system respond in a timely manner?

2. Suppose the fibonacciGenerator fails (e.g. due to invalid input or system failure), the API fails to process and responds with a non-delimited response?

3. If the server is overloaded (overloaded), will the API continue to return incorrect results, or will it time out or crash?

4. After a calculation error occurs (e.g., timeout, invalid input), does the system recover its state to continue serving subsequent requests?

5. What metrics are currently used to evaluate the system's responses? (e.g., response time under 1 second)

6. Is there an SLA guarantee for this API? If it fails to return a correct result within 1 second, is any internal alert triggered?
